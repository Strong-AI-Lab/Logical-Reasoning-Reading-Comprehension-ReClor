# PARARULE Plus
The new generated dataset for PARARULE. It is generated based on the closed-world assumption.
PARARULE Plus is a deep multi-step reasoning dataset over natural language. It can be seen as an improvement on the dataset of PARARULE (Peter Clark et al., 2020). The motivation is to generate deeper PARARULE training samples. We add more training samples for the case where the depth is greater than or equal to two to explore whether Transformer has reasoning ability. PARARULE Plus is a combination of two types of entities, `animals` and `people`, and corresponding relationships and attributes. From the depth of 2 to the depth of 5, we have 100,000 samples in the depth of each layer, and there are a total of 400,000 samples.
## Animals
`Animal Entities` ['the bald eagle', 'the tiger', 'the bear', 'the lion', 'the wolf', 'the crocodile', 'the dinosaur', 'the snake', 'the leopard']

`Animal Entities-2` ['the cat', 'the dog', 'the mouse', 'the rabbit', 'the squirrel']

`Animal Relationship` ['is', 'likes', 'chases', 'needs', 'visits', 'attacks', 'sees']

`Animal Attributes-1` ['kind', 'quiet', 'round', 'nice', 'smart', 'clever']

`Animal Attributes-2` ['dull', 'rough', 'lazy', 'slow', 'sleepy', 'boring', 'tired', 'reckless']

`Animal Attributes-3` ['furry', 'small', 'cute', 'lovely', 'beautiful', 'funny']

`Animal Attributes-4` = ['big', 'strong', 'awful', 'fierce', 'heavy', 'horrible', 'powerful', 'angry']

|The Num of Animal Entities|The Num of Animal Relationships|The Num of Animal Attributes|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|14|7|28|

## People
`People Entities` ['Anne', 'Alan', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave', 'Erin', 'Harry', 'Gary', 'Fiona']

`People Relationship` ['is']

`People Attributes-1` ['big', 'strong', 'high', 'huge']

`People Attributes-2` ['short', 'thin', 'small', 'little', 'tiny']

`People Attributes-3` ['wealthy', 'smart', 'nice', 'quiet', 'kind', 'clever']

`People Attributes-4` = ['poor', 'dull', 'rough', 'bad', 'sad']

## PARARULE Plus Data distribution
For each depth dataset, we have more than 100,000 datasets to be used, much larger than the same depth in PARARULE.

## Examples
### An example with the non-negation rules for Depth=2 means the question needed to be derived by two rules.
<img src="./image/NonNegationRule-D2-1-2.PNG" width="550" />
The `QCat=0` means the question is generated from non-negation rules and the label is `true`. If the `QCat=0_0`, it means the question is generated from non-negation rules and the label is `false`.
