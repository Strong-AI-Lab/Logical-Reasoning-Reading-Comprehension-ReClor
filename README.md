# Logical-Reasoning-Reading-Comprehension-ReClor
Here is the code for the #6 to the ReClor Logical Reasoning Reading Comprehension leaderboard. 

Here is the link for the ReClor leaderboard. We are the team "qbao775". The method we used is RoBERTa-large finetuned on MNLI. In the first submission, we use the RoBERTa-large-mnli (https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli) from the Huggingface.
