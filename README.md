Here is the link for the ReClor leaderboard. We are the team `qbao775`. The method we used is `RoBERTa-large` finetuned on `MNLI` dataset. In the first submission, we use the `RoBERTa-large-mnli` (https://huggingface.co/roberta-large-mnli) from the Huggingface.

We also finetune a RoBERTa-large-mnli by ourselves. The finetuning code is in the `finetune.py`.

The files under the MNLI can be downloaded from here, which are organized from the original MNLI website.

##  How to run the code?
Before you run the code, you need to download the MNLI folder from the Google drive link and put it under the MNLI folder.

Our **#6** submission code is the `run_roberta_large_mnli.sh` which located in the `scripts` folder. You can run it directly.

If you want to finetune a RoBERTa-large-mnli by yourself, you can try to run the `finetune.py`.
